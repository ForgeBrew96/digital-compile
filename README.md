Compile Data Base - App: Protocol Center

Link to Greater Than Game's Compile Cover => https://cf.geekdo-images.com/-QnkDgBxFEgpBWJwAwSxhQ__imagepage/img/mKIb6izwNLq8K_RNRhWFe_d89VI=/fit-in/900x600/filters:no_upscale():strip_icc()/pic8107946.png

What is the function of this app in MVP?
. User should be able to view all of Card in Compile, see the rule manuel and gain access to links to purchase the game
. User should be able to create an account that allows them to create custom cards that show up in their account.
. User should be able to update, delete custom cards
. Compile is a great game that can easily be adapted to a virtual experience. The game has little to no viewable data online. This site allows users to learn everything about the game prior to purchasing. The goal would be to be able to program the virtual experience of the game with this now established API of the card content.
